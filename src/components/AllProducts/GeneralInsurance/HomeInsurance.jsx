                  Home insurance, also commonly called homeowner&apos;s
                  insurance, is a type of property insurance that covers a
                  private residence. It is an insurance policy that combines
                  various personal insurance protections, which can include
                  losses occurring to one's home, its contents, loss of use
                  (additional living expenses), or loss of other personal
                  possessions of the homeowner, as well as liability insurance
                  for accidents that may happen at the home or at the hands of
                  the homeowner within the policy territory. Additionally,
                  homeowner's insurance provides financial protection against
                  disasters. A standard home insurance policy insures the home
                  itself along with the things kept inside.
